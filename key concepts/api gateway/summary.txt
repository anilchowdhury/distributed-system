
API Gateway is used for
		- to decouple the client from services
				
	- Separate out cross cutting concern
		- Authentication, Authorization, SSL termination, DDos Protection, API rate limiting (Throttling), Logging and monitoring
		- All these functionalities will be common to all the backend microservices. Hence moving them
		  to a single component will help each of the microservice to focus on it own individual business 
		  function
		
	- Routing
		- Based on request URL, it can direct the request to the write microservice
		- can provide load balancing
		
	- Can also be used as reverse proxy
		- Any mature project, which has opened its APIs to the outside world would avoid exposing its backend URLs for security 
		  reasons and abstracting the complexity of backend services to client applications
		- serving static content
		- caching backend repsonse and serving to client from its cache		
		
	- Help in transmitting user request to the backend protocol 
		e.g. if client is communicating through HTTP-2, WebSocket, but if the backend service is not 
		ready or compatible with these protocols then API gateway will act as intermediate layer
		and convert the client request to http request and vice-versa
		
	- API gateway can aggregate multiple individual requests into a single request. This pattern applies when 
	  a single operation requires calls to multiple backend services. This helps to reduce chattiness between 
	  the client and the backend.
	
	- IP Listing 
		— Allow or Block certain IP addresses to pass through. Provides an additional layer of security to your ecosystem, 
		  useful when you discover a malicious set of addresses trying to bring down your application by using DDoS sort 
		  of attacks
		
	Drawbacks:
		Increased complexity — The API gateway is yet another moving part that
		must be developed, deployed and managed.
