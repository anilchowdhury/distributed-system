CDN
	- presence of edge servers (Point of Presence PoP servers)
		- reduces the rount trip time by serving the content from the closest vicinty of the user

	- caching servers
		- accelarte the website load time 
		- reduce the bandwidth consumption, as for every request no need to go to origin server
		- store the content in RAM + SSD	

	- if the user base is localized and majority of the request comes from the region where website is hosted, 
	  then not much benefit will be achieved by using CDN
	  
	- modify DNS configuration
		- root domain A record is change to point to one of the CDN's IP
		- for each sub-domain modify its CNAME record to point to CDN-provided subdomain address
		- in both the cases, DNS will route all the requests to CDN servers

	- static contents
		- template images, logo
		- videos
		- music
		- css
		- javascript	
		
CDN types
	- Push CDN
		- Origin server has the responsibiltiy to push the changes to the CDN 
		- Sites with minimal amounts of traffic will fare better with the push system 
		- when you don't change the content very often 
		- when you upload large size videos, it better to uploaded it to CDN beforehand		  
		- when item in an inventory is over, so you want to psuh this information to CDN 
		  so that it does not appear for purchase
		
	
	- Pull CDN
		- CDN servers will pull the changes to the resources from the origin server		
		- the content is put onto the CDN once and left up, rather than re-pulled at regular intervals
		- Sites that receive a great deal of traffic work best with pull CDNs
		
		
Advantage of CDN
	- reduce latency by bringing content closer to the user & cutting down Round trip time 
	- reduce page load time, as static contents(javascript & css files, template images, music, videos) can be served from cache
		- only dynamic query will be sent to the origin server(user's order details)
	- improve user experience by reduing Time to First Byte (TTFB)
		- reducing numer of HTTP requests, file compression, provide progressive rendering of images
	
	- provide website security by blocking DDoS floods attack
	- handle TLS/SSL security on your behalf. Thus multiple RTTs required for SLL handsake will now take less time 
      as user need to send SYN messages to CDN server which is closet to it	
	- provide load balancing
	- provide reliability by avoiding single point of failure
	- provide sage guard when there is sudden increase in traffic	
	
	- route optimizations by using tier1 network service. CDN are connected directly to tier1 network
	  thus reducing the hops count
		- tier1 -> global network providers; tier2 -> broadband providers; tier3 -> university network, regional ISPs
	- they uses fibre optics cable for mode of communications
	
	- provide purging capability -> i.e. origin server can force the CDN server to remove the cache copied of resource
		- an item in the inventory is over, you don't want to show that item as available, you cannot wait for CDN cache 
		  validity to time out before it can refresh from the origin server
		- user has deleted its account, so you want all its post, pics etc. to be immediately removed from all the CDNs servers
